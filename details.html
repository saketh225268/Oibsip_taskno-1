        <h2 style="text-align:center">Rio de Janerio</h2>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px">Rio de Janeiro, in full Cidade de São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro, byname Rio, city and port, capital of the estado 
            (state) of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is located on the Atlantic Ocean, in the southeastern part of the tropical 
            zone of South America, and is widely recognized as one of the world's most beautiful and interesting urban centres.
            Although Rio de Janeiro continues to be the preeminent icon of Brazil in the eyes of many in the world, in reality 
            its location, architecture, inhabitants, and lifestyle make it highly unique when compared with other Brazilian cities,
            especially the country's capital of Brasília or the much larger city of São Paulo. The former is a much smaller city dating
            back only to the 1960s, while the latter is a huge, sprawling commercial and manufacturing centre with none of Rio's 
            spectacular natural beauty or captivating charm. Unlike Rio, both are located on flat interior plateaus.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px">The name was given to the city's original site by Portuguese navigators who arrived on January 1,
             1502, and mistook the entrance of the bay for the mouth of a river (rio is the Portuguese word for “river” and janeiro the word for “January”).
              When the foundations of the future town were laid in 1565, it was named Cidade de São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro (“City of St. Sebastian of 
              Rio de Janeiro”) for both São Sebastião and Dom Sebastião, king of Portugal.Rio de Janeiro became the colonial capital in 1763 and was the 
              capital of independent Brazil from 1822 until 1960, when the national capital was moved to the new city of Brasília; the territory constituting 
              the former Federal District was converted into Guanabara state, which formed an enclave in Rio de Janeiro state. In March 1975 the two states were 
              fused as the state of Rio de Janeiro. The city of Rio de Janeiro became one of the 14 municipalities of the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro, 
              or Greater Rio, and was designated the capital of the reorganized state. Despite loss of the status, funding, and employment it had enjoyed as Brazil's
              capital, Rio de Janeiro not only survived but thrived as a commercial and financial centre, as well as a tourist magnet. Area city, 485 square miles 
              (1,255 square km); Greater Rio, 2,079 square miles (5,384 square km). Pop. (2010) 6,320,446; Greater Rio, 11,875,063; (2021 est.) 6,775,560; Greater Rio, 12,763,305.</p>
